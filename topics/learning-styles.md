# Learning styles

Students all learn in different ways. Therefore the way you approach teaching/mentoring for a student should also vary. There are many other frameworks for explaining learning styles, going from 4 types of learning to 8. There is no right answer, but it's essential to think about the student you are helping and the problem you are explaining.

Knowing about learning styles is such an essential part of student-centered learning.
